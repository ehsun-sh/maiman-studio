"""A single-polarization coherent link, characterised across modulation formats.

Builds PRBS -> Gray-coded M-QAM -> IQ driver -> IQ modulator -> 90-degree hybrid
with balanced detection, and sweeps the launch power for each format. The result
is the trade the tool exists to let someone explore: every extra bit per symbol
buys spectral efficiency and costs sensitivity, by an amount you can read off.

Run: ``python examples/coherent_link.py``
