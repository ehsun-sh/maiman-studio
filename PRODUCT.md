# Maiman Studio — product context

## What it is

An open-source simulator for optical communication links and photonic systems. Engineers build a
link as a block diagram — laser, modulator, fiber, amplifier, detector — run it, and read the
result as an eye diagram, a BER number, an OSNR figure.

The engine exists and is validated: 671 tests, every physics block checked against a closed-form
result in CI. What does not exist yet is the interface.

The name is **Theodore Maiman's**, who built the first working laser at Hughes Research
Laboratories in May 1960 — a ruby rod that everything modelled here eventually descends from.
It points the project at the physics rather than at a competing product, which the earlier name
did not.

## Who uses it

**Primary: the practising link engineer.** Designs or verifies an optical link. Comes from
OptiSystem or VPIphotonics and expects their muscle memory to transfer. Cares about being right,
and about being able to prove it.

**Secondary: the graduate researcher.** Needs a specific effect modelled correctly and needs to
extend the tool with their own component. Will read the source. Cannot afford a commercial licence
— which is the reason this project exists.

**Tertiary: the student.** Learning what dispersion does to a pulse. Needs the tool to be
legible before it is powerful.

## The scene

A desk, two monitors, a long working session. The engineer is *iterating*: change a parameter,
run, look at the eye, change it again. Dozens of times an hour. Sometimes at night in a dim room,
just as often in a lit office. Frequently alongside a datasheet PDF and a terminal.

That scene decides several things. The interface ships **two grounds and defaults to the light
one** — a schematic is a document before it is a screen, and the plots leave here for reports,
theses and papers, where a screenshot off a black canvas is the wrong artefact. Graphite is one
click away for the night session beside a terminal. Neither is a skin over the other: the port
hues are the identity and survive both, but their values are re-derived per ground rather than
inverted, and the eye diagram's density ramp is rebuilt so that in both cases *distance from the
page* means count.

The interface is also **dense** — screen space spent on decoration is screen space not spent
on the schematic or the plot. And the run/inspect cycle must feel **instant**, because it happens
constantly and any latency compounds.

## What the GUI must do

1. Build and edit a link as a node graph, with invalid connections refused at edit time.
2. Edit component parameters with their real units visible.
3. Run, and show progress on a run that takes seconds to minutes.
4. Display results: eye diagram, spectrum, BER curves, sweep results.
5. Open and save `.maiman` projects.
6. Sweep a parameter and plot the curve.

## Constraints that are already decided

* **The GUI is a client of the public Python API.** If a feature is not reachable from Python, it
  does not exist. The GUI gets no privileged access.
* **The component palette is generated** from `maiman.manifests()`, never hand-written, so it
  cannot drift from what the engine actually offers.
* **Result data is reduced in the engine**, never in the browser. An eye diagram arrives as a
  binned histogram of fixed size; the browser never receives a raw sample buffer.
* **Port types are enforced**: optical, electrical, binary, symbol, metric. The editor must make
  a type mismatch visibly impossible rather than merely erroring on run.
* Web-first. The canvas is hand-drawn SVG rather than React Flow: React Flow needs npm and a
  bundler, and the project has no build step, which is what lets the page open straight off disk
  with nothing installed. Revisit if the canvas grows past what that can carry. Optional desktop
  wrapper is packaging, not architecture.

## Brand commitments

**Spectral identity** (chosen by the project owner). Accent colours derive from real optical
wavelengths rather than being picked for taste: C-band cyan as the primary, and the port types
keyed to distinct points so a wire's colour tells an engineer what travels down it. The tool is
about light; its palette should be too.

## What would make a polished result feel wrong

* Consumer-app airiness. Generous whitespace, large type, and gentle animation read as *slow* to
  someone doing this fifty times an hour.
* Hiding density behind progressive disclosure. This audience wants the numbers on screen.
* A novel arrangement for the schematic editor. Familiarity here is a feature; invention belongs
  in the physics, not in where the palette lives.
* Any claim the engine cannot back. Every number shown must come from a real run.

## Success

An engineer who has used OptiSystem sits down, finds everything where they expect it, builds a
link in two minutes, and gets a number they trust.
