"""The simulation graph and its execution engine.

Execution is **block-mode**: each component is invoked exactly once per run and
processes the entire time window in a single call. This is what commercial
system simulators do, and it makes every block a pure function of its inputs,
which in turn is what allows vectorised (and later GPU) implementations without
any change to the scheduler.

It is deliberately *not* a streaming, sample-at-a-time scheduler like GNU Radio.
Optical system simulation runs a fixed-length sequence and analyses the result;
streaming would buy nothing and complicate every block.
