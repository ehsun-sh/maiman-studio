"""The ``.maiman`` project file: a graph, saved.

The format is versioned JSON, chosen so a project is readable, diffable, and
usable without this library — a schematic that can only be opened by the program
that wrote it is not a durable record of an experiment.

Three rules shape it:

* **Semantic data and UI data are separate.** Node positions live under ``ui``,
  so a diff shows what changed about the *physics* without a hundred lines of
  moved boxes on top of it.
* **Only explicitly-set parameters are stored.** A file records the choices its
  author made, not the defaults they accepted, which keeps files small and
  diffs legible. The trade-off is real and worth stating: if a model's default
  changes in a later release, a file that never overrode it will simulate
  slightly differently. ``maiman_version`` is recorded so that is diagnosable.
* **Names are looked up, never imported.** See :mod:`maiman.registry`.

A project file is always runnable headless: nothing here requires a GUI, and
the ``ui`` section is optional.
