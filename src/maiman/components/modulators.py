    """Push-pull Mach-Zehnder modulator, chirp-free.

    An ideal symmetric MZ interferometer driven push-pull has power transmission

        P_out / P_in = cos**2(pi * V_total / (2 * V_pi))

    with ``V_total = V_drive + V_bias``: full transmission at 0 V, a null at
    ``V_pi``, and half power at the quadrature point ``V_pi / 2``.

    A real device cannot reach a perfect null, so the finite extinction ratio is
    folded in as a floor::

        P_out / P_in = IL * [ (1 - 1/ER) * cos**2(pi*V/(2*V_pi)) + 1/ER ]

    which peaks at ``IL`` and bottoms at ``IL/ER``, so the measured extinction
    ratio equals the declared one exactly — asserted in the test suite.

    Push-pull drive is chirp-free by construction: the field transmission is real
    and non-negative here, and the pi phase jump past the null is carried by the
    sign of the field. Chirped (single-drive) operation is a separate model.

    Modulator bandwidth is not yet limited; the drive is applied sample by
    sample. That refinement lives entirely in this block.

    """Dual-parallel MZM: two child modulators combined in quadrature.

    The input field is split, driven through two push-pull MZMs each biased at
    its own null, recombined with one arm delayed by a quarter wave, and emitted::

        E_out = (E_in / 2) * [ t(V_I + bias_I) + exp(j*(pi/2 + err)) * t(V_Q + bias_Q) ]

    with ``t(V) = sin(pi*V / (2*V_pi))`` the *field* transmission of a
    null-biased push-pull arm. This is the block that makes the tool able to
    represent anything past on-off keying: the field, not just its magnitude, is
    now under control, which is what a coherent receiver is built to recover.

    Three properties of the model are worth being explicit about.

    **The 3 dB is real.** With both arms driven to full swing the output power is
    half the input. That is not a modelling loss — it is what a dual-parallel
    structure costs, and it is why a coherent transmitter's launch power budget
    starts 3 dB behind an intensity-modulated one.

    **The sine is real too.** ``t`` is linear only for small drives. At full swing
    it compresses the outer levels of a 16-QAM constellation while leaving QPSK
    exactly alone, because QPSK only ever visits the extremes. Correcting it is
    the transmitter DSP's job; see
    :class:`~maiman.components.electrical.IQDriver`'s ``predistort``.

    **Bias error leaks carrier.** ``bias_i``/``bias_q`` are departures from the
    null. Any offset means ``t(0) != 0``, so an unmodulated component of the
    carrier reaches the output and the constellation acquires a DC offset — which
    is precisely what the residual-carrier spur on a spectrum analyser is, and
    what an automatic bias controller exists to null out.
