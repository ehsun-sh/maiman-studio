class CoherentReceiver(Component):
    """90-degree hybrid and two balanced photodiode pairs.

    The signal and the local oscillator are mixed in a 2x4 hybrid whose outputs
    are ``(E_s +- E_lo)/2`` and ``(E_s +- j*E_lo)/2``. Differencing each pair
    cancels the direct-detection terms and leaves the beat::

        i_I = R * Re(E_s . conj(E_lo))
        i_Q = R * Im(E_s . conj(E_lo))

    so the two photocurrents are the real and imaginary parts of the optical
    field itself, amplified by the LO. That is the whole point of coherent
    detection: phase survives, and with it every modulation format that lives
    off the real axis.

    **The dot product is over polarization.** ``E_s . conj(E_lo)`` is the Jones
    inner product ``Ex_s*conj(Ex_lo) + Ey_s*conj(Ey_lo)``, so a signal orthogonal
    to the LO produces no photocurrent at all. Polarization fading is not an
    add-on here; it falls out of the model, and a single-polarization coherent
    receiver really does go deaf when the fibre rotates the signal onto the
    orthogonal state.

    **Frequency offset falls out too.** Bands carry their own centre frequency,
    so a signal and an LO that do not sit at the same frequency beat at their
    difference: the mixing term picks up ``exp(2j*pi*(f_s - f_lo)*t)`` and the
    constellation rotates. This is intradyne operation, and the residual rotation
    is what a carrier-recovery stage exists to undo.

    **Noise convention.** The LO dominates: each of the four photodiodes receives
    about ``P_lo/4``, and differencing a pair adds their independent shot noises,
    giving ``var = q * R * P_lo * B`` on each of I and Q. With that convention the
    shot-noise-limited Q-factor of QPSK is ``sqrt(R*P_s / (2*q*B))``, which the
    test suite asserts against a counted error rate rather than assuming.

    **ASE beats with the LO, and on an amplified link that is the noise floor.**
    The hybrid mixes everything at its input against the local oscillator, and
    accompanying ASE is not exempt::

        var = R**2 * (P_lo_x * S_x + P_lo_y * S_y) * B

    on each of I and Q, with ``S`` the one-sided ASE density per polarization and
    ``B`` the same bandwidth the shot noise uses. It is written per polarization
    for the same reason the shot term is not: only ASE co-polarized with the LO
    beats down to baseband, which is why a polarization-diverse receiver collects
    twice the noise of a single-polarization one and hears twice as much signal
    for it.

    There is no optical-filter parameter here, and there does not need to be one.
    A coherent receiver filters itself: only ASE within the electrical bandwidth
    of the LO reaches baseband at all, so the spontaneous-spontaneous term that
    forces a direct-detection front end to carry a filter is absent by
    construction. That is a real advantage of the architecture rather than a
    simplification of the model.

    Only the signal band nearest the LO is detected. The others beat at their
    frequency separation — hundreds of GHz for any realistic channel grid — which
    is far outside the electrical bandwidth of any receiver. They are genuinely
    rejected here rather than merely negligible, and a WDM demultiplexer in front
    is what makes that true in hardware.

    """Polarization-diverse coherent receiver: four photocurrents, not two.

    The signal is split by a polarization beam splitter, the LO is split with it,
    and each pair goes to its own 90-degree hybrid. The result is the *complete*
    optical field: two complex quadratures on each of two orthogonal states, from
    which any launched polarization can be reconstructed by linear combination.

    That last clause is the point. A single-polarization receiver goes deaf when
    the fibre rotates the signal onto the orthogonal state; this one cannot,
    because it measures both states and lets the DSP recombine them. It is why a
    coherent link can carry two independent tributaries at one wavelength while a
    direct-detection link carries one.

    The PBS axes are the receiver's own, and they bear no relation to whatever
    the transmitter launched — a fibre rotates the state arbitrarily and drifts.
    So ``x`` and ``y`` here are *not* the two tributaries. Separating those is
    :class:`~maiman.components.dsp.ButterflyEqualizer`'s job, and without it these
    outputs are two mixtures rather than two channels.

    The noise convention is inherited unchanged: each hybrid sees half the LO
    power, so the per-quadrature shot variance is half the single-polarization
    receiver's, and splitting the signal likewise halves what each branch
    receives. The two effects cancel in the SNR, which is why polarization
    multiplexing doubles capacity at the same SNR per tributary rather than
    costing 3 dB.

class CarrierRecovery(Component):
    """Blind carrier phase recovery, by phase search.

    A transmitter laser and a local oscillator are independent oscillators, so
    the phase between them performs a random walk whose rate is set by their
    linewidths. Nothing upstream can remove it: it is not a constant, and it is
    not a frequency offset either, so subtracting a line does not help. Left in,
    it puts a **floor** under the measured SNR that no amount of launch power
    lifts — at 100 kHz and 32 GBd, around 18 dB, which is not enough for 16-QAM.

    This block is what a real receiver does about it. See
    :func:`maiman.modulation.blind_phase_search` for the method.

    **The quadrant ambiguity is real and is not hidden.** Every QAM constellation
    here is invariant under a quarter turn, so no blind estimator can tell which
    quadrant it is in; the recovered phase is right modulo pi/2. A deployed link
    resolves this by differentially encoding the quadrant, which costs a little
    sensitivity. That is not implemented yet, so what remains after this block is
    a *constant* rotation by some multiple of pi/2 — and the measurement block
    removes it data-aided, the way a bench analyser does with the pattern in
    hand. The time-varying part, which is the part that actually costs SNR, is
    gone by then.

    A **cycle slip** is the failure mode to know about: if the phase walks faster
    than the window can follow, the estimate latches onto a neighbouring quadrant
    and stays there, and every symbol after the slip is decided in the wrong
    quadrant. It does not degrade gracefully. Widening ``window`` tracks noise
    better but slips sooner; narrowing it does the reverse.
