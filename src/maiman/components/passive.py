    point is to put two carriers at the same wavelength into the same fibre
    without them interfering — which orthogonal polarizations allow and nothing
    else does.

    That is what doubles the capacity of every modern coherent link, and it is
    why the field has been carried as a Jones vector since the first commit
    rather than as a scalar.

    Combining orthogonal states is **lossless**, unlike a power combiner. Only
    the ``x`` component of each input is used: each arm is expected to come from
    a modulator fed by a single-polarization laser, which is what the transmitter
    actually looks like.
