    """Erbium-doped fiber amplifier: gain, plus the noise that comes with it.

    Amplification is not free. A phase-insensitive amplifier must add at least
    ``h*nu`` of noise per mode per unit bandwidth, and a real one adds more; the
    noise figure is how much more. The amplified spontaneous emission this block
    generates is what limits how many spans a link can have, so an amplifier
    modelled without it is not a simplification but a fiction.

    ASE is emitted into :class:`~maiman.signals.NoiseBin` rather than into the
    sampled bands. That is the whole reason the noise-bin representation exists:
    ASE covers the amplifier's full bandwidth — terahertz — while the signal
    occupies a few tens of gigahertz of it. Sampling both together would demand
    a sample rate no machine can afford, so the noise is carried as a power
    spectral density and only converted to samples where a detector or a
    nonlinearity actually needs it.

    The spontaneous emission factor follows from the noise figure::

        n_sp = NF * G / (2 * (G - 1))
        S_ASE = n_sp * h * nu * (G - 1)        [W/Hz, per polarization]

    **Saturation is a clamp, not a model.** ``max_output_power`` limits the
    output and the gain is reduced to whatever achieves it; real gain
    compression depends on the inversion level and has dynamics this does not
    capture. Left at its default the amplifier is unsaturated.
