    """Undoes :class:`QAMMapper`'s differential quadrant encoding.

    Slices the received symbols against the quadrant-labelled alphabet, differences
    the quadrant back out, and re-emits them under the ordinary Gray labelling — so
    what comes out can be compared directly against a plain mapper fed the same
    bits, with no special handling anywhere downstream.

    **What this buys.** Every blind stage upstream leaves a quarter-turn
    ambiguity: the phase search cannot resolve it, and the butterfly equaliser has
    it too. Absolute labelling turns that into total data loss. Differencing turns
    it into a constant that cancels, so a receiver that settles a quarter turn
    away decodes correctly anyway.

    **What it costs.** A symbol error that crosses a quadrant boundary corrupts
    two consecutive symbols instead of one, because each quadrant is decoded
    relative to its predecessor. Roughly a factor of two in error rate near
    threshold — the standard price of differential coding, and much the better
    trade against losing everything.

    The first symbol has no predecessor and carries no data; discard it, as
    ``ignore_edges`` on the analyser already does.

    **This block emits decisions, so do not measure EVM after it.** Differencing
    the quadrant requires slicing first, and what comes out is ideal constellation
    points — an EVM taken here is exactly zero however bad the link is. Modulation
    quality is a soft measurement and belongs upstream, on the recovered symbols;
    the error count is a hard one and belongs here. A link that wants both needs
    an analyser in each place, which is also how a bench does it.
