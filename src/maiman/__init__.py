"""Maiman Studio — simulation of optical communication links and photonic systems.

The public surface is deliberately small. Everything the GUI will eventually do
goes through it: if a feature is not reachable from here, it does not exist.

    >>> from maiman import SimulationContext, Graph
    >>> from maiman.components import CWLaser, Fiber, PowerMeter
    >>> ctx = SimulationContext(bit_rate=10e9, samples_per_symbol=16, sequence_length=64)
    >>> g = Graph(ctx)
    >>> laser = g.add(CWLaser(power=0.0, wavelength=1550.0))
    >>> fiber = g.add(Fiber(length=80.0, attenuation=0.2))
    >>> meter = g.add(PowerMeter())
    >>> g.chain(laser, fiber, meter)
    >>> round(g.run()[meter].power_dbm, 3)
