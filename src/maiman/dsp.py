"""Receiver DSP: dispersion compensation, pulse shaping, adaptive equalisation.

Two impairments are undone here, and they are undone separately because they are
different kinds of problem. **Chromatic dispersion is deterministic**: a known,
static, all-pass phase that one fixed filter inverts exactly, and it can be
hundreds of taps long. **Polarization mixing is not**: it is a random rotation
that drifts on a millisecond timescale, so it needs a short adaptive filter that
tracks. Trying to do both with one adaptive filter needs it to be both long and
fast, which is the worst of each. Every deployed coherent receiver splits them in
exactly this order, and so does this module.

    ``accumulated_dispersion`` is D·L in s/m — the *product*, because that is the
    only thing a receiver can know. It cannot see how the span was built, and two
    links with the same total behave identically, so asking for D and L
    separately would invent a distinction that does not exist on this side of the
    fibre. ``wavelength`` is needed because β₂ is D scaled by λ².

    Chromatic dispersion is a pure phase, ``exp(i β₂ ω² z / 2)``, with unit
    magnitude at every frequency. Nothing is lost and nothing is buried under
    noise — the received field still holds all of it, just rearranged in time —
    which is why a link that is completely closed at the photodiode reopens to
    within a fraction of a dB of back-to-back. That is not error correction. It is
    the inverse of an invertible operation.

    **This calls the fibre's own propagator with a negated distance rather than
    writing the inverse transfer function out.** The two would be equivalent only
    as long as nobody edits one of them, and the sign of β₂ is exactly the kind of
    thing that drifts apart across two copies. Structurally there is one filter
    here, run in reverse; a sign error in it can only be a sign error in the
    forward model, which the propagation tests already pin.

    The window is periodic, so the filter wraps — as the forward propagation
    wrapped. That is self-consistent within a run, and it is why compensation
    returns *exactly* the launched waveform rather than approximately. Over a real
    span the wrap is a genuine edge effect and the outer symbols are dropped, as
    ``ignore_edges`` on the analysers already does.
