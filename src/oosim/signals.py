"""Signal types carried between components.

The optical signal model is the single most consequential decision in the whole
engine, so the reasoning is spelled out here rather than left to the design doc.

**Why a list of bands.** A scalar centre frequency can represent exactly one
carrier. A 40-channel DWDM system spans several THz; sampling that as one band
would need a sample rate no machine can afford. Real system simulators therefore
carry a *set* of independently sampled bands, each with its own centre frequency,
and only merge them onto a common grid where physics forces it. Building this in
from the start costs almost nothing; retrofitting it means rewriting every block.

**Why noise is separate.** Amplifier ASE covers the whole amplifier bandwidth
while the signal occupies a small slice of it. Represented as samples, the noise
alone would dictate the sample rate. Carried as spectral bins with a power
spectral density, it costs a handful of floats and is only converted to samples
where a detector or a nonlinearity actually needs signal-noise beating.

**Field convention.** ``Ex`` and ``Ey`` are complex envelope amplitudes scaled so
that instantaneous power is ``|Ex|**2 + |Ey|**2`` in watts — i.e. the fields are
in units of sqrt(W). Average power is the mean of that over the time window.
