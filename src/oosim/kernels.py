"""Numerical kernels.

Everything computationally heavy goes through this module. It is deliberately
narrow — a handful of array-in/array-out functions with no knowledge of
components, graphs, or units — so that the back-end can change without touching
any physics code above it. Today that back-end is NumPy; CuPy (`cupy.fft` is a
drop-in for `numpy.fft`) and a native module are the intended next options.

**FFT library.** `numpy.fft` uses pocketfft (BSD). FFTW is *not* used and must
not be introduced: it is GPL-2.0-or-later, and linking it — directly or through
`pyFFTW` — would relicense the whole project.
