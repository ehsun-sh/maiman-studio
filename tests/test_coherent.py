"""The coherent transceiver, end to end.

The chain under test is PRBS -> QAM mapper -> IQ driver -> IQ modulator ->
coherent receiver -> sampler -> analyser. What makes these tests worth having is
that most of them compare against something derived outside the code: the
shot-noise-limited SNR against a closed form, the counted symbol error rate
against :func:`maiman.modulation.ser_qam`, the modulator's intrinsic loss against
the 3 dB a dual-parallel structure costs by construction.
