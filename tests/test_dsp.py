"""Receiver DSP in the link: what carrier recovery is actually for.

The claim these tests exist to check is not "the block runs" but a physical one:
**with an uncompensated carrier, launching more power stops helping.** Laser
phase noise is a random walk, so it is not removable by subtracting a constant or
a line, and it puts a ceiling on the measured SNR that no power budget lifts.
Carrier recovery removes the ceiling. Both halves are asserted.
