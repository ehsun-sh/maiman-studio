"""Validation of the receiver filter, Q-factor, and BER.

The central test here compares two independent routes to the same number: the
BER predicted from Q under the Gaussian approximation, and the BER obtained by
counting how many bits the decision circuit actually got wrong. Nothing in the
code makes those agree — if the noise model, the filter's noise bandwidth, the
threshold placement, or the Q definition is wrong, they diverge.
