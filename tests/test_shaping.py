"""Pulse shaping and differential encoding.

Two transmitter-side refinements with sharply different jobs. Root-raised-cosine
shaping bounds the spectrum, which is what lets channels be packed onto a grid at
all. Differential quadrant encoding closes the quarter-turn ambiguity that every
blind receiver stage upstream leaves behind.

The second is tested *without* the constellation analyser, deliberately. That
block removes a common rotation data-aided, using the transmitted sequence — so
it is immune to the ambiguity by construction and would report success either
way. A real receiver has no reference, so the comparison here is made where it
actually bites: on the decoded symbols themselves.
