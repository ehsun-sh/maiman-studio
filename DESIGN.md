# Design

The visual and interaction record for Maiman Studio's interface. It exists because
[`docs/ui-mockup.html`](docs/ui-mockup.html) is a *build*, and a build without a
written rationale is a set of numbers nobody can argue with later. Everything
here was decided against the audience and use scene in [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md);
where a decision was made by measurement rather than judgement, the measurement
is given.

## 1. What the surface is

An **Operate** surface: a schematic editor, used to complete a task rather than
to be admired or read through. Scanability, consistency and the real usage scene
outrank expression. Brand lives in precise details, not in gestures.

The engineer is *iterating* — change a parameter, run, look at the constellation,
change it again — dozens of times an hour. Three consequences follow, and they
decide most of what is below:

1. **Density beats generosity.** Screen space spent on decoration is space not
   spent on the schematic or the plot.
2. **Recognition beats novelty.** The layout is the one this audience already
   knows from Blender, VS Code and EDA tools. Nothing is moved to be different.
3. **Nothing on screen may be invented.** Every number, every parameter, every
   port comes from a real engine run. See §7.

---

## 2. Two grounds

The interface ships **paper** and **graphite**, and defaults to paper.

A schematic is a document before it is a screen. Its plots leave the tool for
reports, theses and papers, where a screenshot off a black canvas is the wrong
artefact. Graphite is one click away for the night session beside a terminal.

Neither is a skin over the other:

| | paper | graphite |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ground | `#e9edf3` bed under white panels | `#0b0e13` under `#11151c` panels |
| a block | white card on a grey bed | raised panel on a dark one |
| hover | adds **ink** (darker) | adds **light** |
| plot bed | `#ffffff` — a plot is on paper | `#080b10` |

The port hues are the identity and survive both, but their **values are
re-derived per ground rather than inverted** — on paper the spectrum darkens to
hold contrast against a light bed.

**Structure.** The bare `:root` block carries the complete paper palette. The
graphite tokens appear twice: once under
`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` guarded as `:root:not([data-theme="light"])`,
and once under `:root[data-theme="dark"]` so an explicit choice wins in both
directions. No colour is ever defined *only* inside a media or `[data-theme]`
block — that is the classic unreadable-page bug, and it is checked rather than
assumed (§8).

---

## 3. The spectral port identity

**Every port colour is a wavelength, not a preference.** A wire's colour tells
you what travels down it.

| port type | paper | graphite |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| optical (C-band) | `#0a8279` | `#22d3c5` |
| electrical | `#a35f00` | `#f0a030` |
| binary | `#5a6474` | `#7c86a0` |
| symbol | `#6539cc` | `#9b7cf6` |
| metric | `#bc2668` | `#e85d9b` |

This is the one place the interface is allowed to be memorable, and it earns its
place by being *information*: a typed-port system that refuses invalid wiring at
edit time is meaningless if the types are invisible.

The shown project is chosen so that **all five types appear on the canvas at
once**. That is why it is a coherent link rather than an on-off-keyed one: only
a coherent chain carries binary into symbols, symbols into two electrical
drives, an optical field, two photocurrents back, and symbols out again. It runs
over 80 km of real fibre, because a simulator whose demonstration link has no
fibre in it is showing the wrong thing.

Accent is `--optical`, because the tool is an optical simulator. Semantic colour
(`--good` / `--warn` / `--bad`) is kept separate from it and does not count as
the accent.

## 4. The ink ladder

Four layers, spaced so hierarchy comes from the **distance between them** rather
than from pushing the weakest below readability.

| token | paper | vs white | graphite | role |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- |
| `--ink` | `#0f141c` | 18.5 | `#e6ecf5` | values, headings |
| `--ink-2` | `#333d4b` | 11.0 | `#a8b4c6` | labels, body |
| `--ink-3` | `#4c5666` | 7.4 | `#8e9bb0` | section titles, axes |
| `--ink-4` | `#5f6a79` | 5.5 | `#7a869b` | units, ranges, disabled |

The bottom rung is set by the **tinted grounds it actually lands on** — a unit
inside an input well, a disabled toolbar label — not by white, where it would
look too pale. Against the darkest surface it still clears 4.5:1.

---

## 5. Layout

Four regions, top to bottom:

```
menu bar            34px   File / Edit / Simulate / View / Help, ground switch, engine state
action toolbar      40px   Run, Stop, Sweep · select/pan/align · zoom · run context
body                1fr    palette 216px | node canvas 1fr | inspector 260px
results dock        292px  tabs + metric strip, plot + side readouts
status bar          24px   block and link counts, selection, sample count, precision
```

**Run sits leftmost in the toolbar**, where the eye lands first, because it is
the action taken dozens of times an hour.

**The dock is 292px** because the constellation's plot is square and therefore
sized by the dock's *height*, not its width. A shorter dock wastes the width it
has.

**The canvas viewBox is 1000 x 530**, seven columns of 138px at a node width of
116, three rows at y = 30 / 220 / 410. The seventh column arrived with the span
and its compensator; the alternative was to keep six and squeeze the spacing to
120, which leaves four pixels between adjacent blocks and reads as cramped.

The *height* is set by the region the SVG actually lands in, and that number is
worth measuring rather than estimating. At 1440px the canvas region is
**964 x 510 — an aspect of 1.89**. With `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"`
any box wider than that is letterboxed top and bottom: the original 880 x 420
(2.10) wasted 50px, and widening to 1000 x 420 (2.38) wasted **105px** — it made
the fit worse, not better, which is the opposite of what a first pass here
claimed. Matching the box to 1.89 wastes none, and the rows spread into the
height they gained.

Below 940px the palette and inspector collapse and a note says so. This is a
desktop tool; the real build would dock them as overlays rather than dropping
them, and the note says that too rather than pretending the narrow layout is the
intended one.

---

## 6. Plots

Two reduced result types, and they share a visual language because they mean the
same thing: **distance from the page is how many landed there**.

- **Eye diagram** — density ramp bed → cyan → far stop.
- **Constellation** — the same ramp; axes through the origin, because a
  constellation is read relative to zero and not to the corner of a box; ideal
  points marked with **crosses rather than filled dots**, so a cluster's own
  centre stays visible underneath and a bias offset reads instead of being
  covered by the marker meant to locate it.
- **Sensitivity** — one curve per format, each labelled where it crosses the FEC
  threshold rather than in a legend box. The threshold is 1e-3, not Q = 6:
  nobody operates an error-free channel any more, they operate one a
  soft-decision code can close.

The ramp's mid stop is placed by **luminance**, at roughly the same fraction of
each ground's span, which is what keeps sparse outliers subordinate to the dense
regions on both.

A canvas has no cascade, so the plots read the same tokens as everything else at
draw time and are redrawn when the ground changes. Nothing below the token block
names a colour.

---

## 7. Real data, always

The palette is generated from `manifests()` — the same call the real GUI will
make. The inspector shows true parameters, units, ranges and docstrings. The
constellation, eye and sweep are a real run, exported by
[`examples/export_ui_data.py`](examples/export_ui_data.py).

This is not a purity exercise. Building the mockup against real data has twice
found engine defects that the test suite missed:

- `eye_histogram` accepted any `time_bins` and rendered a 32-sample trace across
  96 columns as **vertical banding**. Time resolution is now capped at one
  column per sample.
- Placing an analyser after the differential decoder reported **EVM of exactly
  zero** however bad the link was, because that block emits decisions. The
  mockup now carries two analysers — soft measurement before the decoder, error
  count after — which is also how a bench does it.
- The sensitivity sweep's 256-QAM curve **never crossed the FEC threshold** in
  the swept range, so it was the one curve with no label — quietly contradicting
  the rule in section 6 that each is labelled where it crosses. The range now
  extends far enough that all four cross.

## 8. What is verified, and how

Not by looking at downscaled screenshots. Each publish is checked by
measurement, in **both grounds**:

- **Contrast** — every text node's computed colour against its resolved
  background; ~110 elements per dock tab. Target 4.5:1 (3:1 for large text).
  Current status: **zero failures**, both grounds, all four tabs.
- **Token completeness** — every `var(--…)` the stylesheet references must
  resolve from bare `:root` alone. Current: 34/34.
- **Theme-block drift** — the two graphite blocks are compared key by key.
- **Canvas repaint** — plot beds are sampled after switching, in both
  directions.
- **Geometry** — no SVG element may stray outside the viewBox; the viewBox
  aspect must match the canvas region's, or the difference is letterboxed away;
  the Ports legend must not overlap a block; no horizontal page overflow.
- **Screenshots** — `python docs/capture_screenshots.py` regenerates
  [`docs/images/`](docs/images/) in both grounds at the same 1440px the audits
  use, so what the README shows is what the current build renders rather than an
  older one. It refuses to run if the mockup's theme bootstrap has changed,
  because the failure mode otherwise is two paper captures, one of them labelled
  graphite.

Two findings worth keeping:

- A contrast audit run while the browser pane was not compositing reported a
  clean result that **meant nothing** — the page had laid out at its narrow
  breakpoint, where the palette and inspector are `display: none` and were never
  checked. It happened a second time on a freshly opened tab, which does not
  inherit the previous tab's emulated size. The audit now asserts
  `innerWidth === 1440` and throws otherwise, and reports how many nodes it
  inspected so a zero is readable as a pass rather than as silence.
- The design detector once ran degraded and returned `[]`. An empty result from
  a degraded tool is an undercount, not a pass.

---

## 9. Decisions worth not re-litigating

- **Paper is the default**, and it is stamped before first paint so a dark host
  never flashes through. The stylesheet still answers `prefers-color-scheme` on
  its own for the no-script case.
- **A backward wire is the schematic wrapping**, not a mistake. It needs a
  *tighter* bezier control offset than a forward one; scaling the offset with
  the span throws the curve outside the canvas on exactly the wire that already
  travels furthest.
- **Node labels truncate with the full name in a tooltip.** A fixed-width box
  that lets long names spill across neighbours is worse than one that clips.
- **Hover on paper adds ink, not light.** Lightening a hover on a white ground
  moves it towards invisible.

---

## 10. Not done

- The mockup shows a single-carrier link. The dual-polarization link is in
  [`examples/dualpol_link.py`](examples/dualpol_link.py) and is not on the
  canvas: at ~20 blocks the node text stops being readable at this canvas size,
  and a schematic nobody can read is not a better demonstration. At 17 blocks
  the current graph is already close to that ceiling.
- No motion beyond the run pulse and the control transitions.
- No empty, loading or error states — there is no session server yet to produce
  them.
